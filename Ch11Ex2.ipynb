    "In a particular factory, a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals. Write a ShiftSupervisor class that is a subclass of the Employee class you created in Programming Exercise 1. The ShiftSupervisor class should keep a data attribute for the annual salary, and a data attribute for the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a ShiftSupervisor object. \n",
